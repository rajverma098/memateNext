      <p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>7.2 Fees payable under your Subscription Plan</strong></p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>When you select your Subscription Plan, you will be informed of the pricing, product tier inclusions, and limitations which are relevant to your Subscription Plan.</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>All Subscription Plans include access to a base subscription, the use of which incurs a fixed monthly Subscription Fee and, depending on your plan, may include access to Premium Features, the use of which incurs additional fees and charges.</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>If the Premium Features you use include online invoice payments, these terms and conditions and fees and charges apply.</p>

If you use Premium Features during your Trial, Fees may apply to those Premium Features. Unless you terminate or cancel your Subscription Plan during the Trial, it will automatically rollover to a paid Subscription Plan at the end of your Trial and you will be required to pay us the Fees described in the Subscription Plan while your subscription remains active. By providing us with your credit card or other payment details and signing electronically to confirm that you agree to the Direct Debit Authority, you authorise us to deduct the Fees payable to us in respect of your use of meMate after the end of the Trial.</p>
<p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>7.4 Payment Terms</strong></p>

<p class='sqsRHFont'>If you are responsible for paying the Fees for your Subscription Plan, you must provide us with a direct debit authority in accordance with section 7.5 and pay Fees by the due date stated on the relevant invoice (unless otherwise agreed with you). Your fixed monthly Subscription Fee is payable in advance, within 7 days of receipt of your invoice. Different payment terms may apply to the use of Premium Features and will be specified in the relevant product terms and conditions.</p>

If your Direct Debit Authority is canceled or withdrawn, you must provide us with a replacement direct debit authority (unless we agree to another payment method).</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(b) Recurring Payments</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>When you purchase a Subscription Plan, you agree that you are authorising recurring payments, and payments will be made to us by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the end of the month in which the Subscription Plan is terminated or canceled.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(c) Processing Fee payments</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>Debiting of Fees will ordinarily occur on the invoice due date (but may occur at other times if permitted under your Direct Debit Authority). If you are responsible for paying the Fees for your Subscription Plan, we will provide you with a monthly invoice detailing the Fees that will be debited from your account.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>Your first base subscription payment for meMate may be pro-rated for the appropriate number of days until the end of that month.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>You can view Premium Feature usage charges (including Pay-Per-Use Fees) at any time via “My Account”. Online invoice payment fees and charges are available via the online invoice payments portal.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>As a Subscriber, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient credit or funds available in your nominated credit card or bank account to cover your monthly payment, and that your credit card or account details are up to date.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>If we cannot debit your Fees from your credit card or bank account, we will notify you that your account has fallen into arrears and may attempt to re-draw up to 3 further times before the direct debit is considered to be dishonoured.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>You are responsible for paying any dishonour fee(s) charged by your financial institution.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>As a Subscriber, you can update your payment details at any time via “Manage my product” within the “My Account” dashboard. Following any update, you authorise us to continue to charge the applicable credit card or bank account, including for any outstanding Fees accrued by you or your Users in connection with your use of meMate.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(d) Late payment</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>If undisputed Fees remain unpaid for a period of 30 days after you receive a written notice from us requiring you to pay the outstanding Fees, we may suspend or terminate your Subscription Plan in accordance with section 8.2(b).</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(e) If there has been a problem</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>If you believe there has been an error in debiting your credit card or bank account, you should notify us immediately at accounts@meMate.com so that we can resolve your query promptly. If your credit card or bank account has been incorrectly debited by more than it should have been, we will arrange a refund of the incorrect debit. If there is a genuine dispute about an amount that was debited from your account, and you have notified us about the dispute, we will hold the amount on trust for you pending the outcome of a dispute resolution process.

   <p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>8.1 Automatic renewal</strong></p>

   <p class='sqsRHFont'>When you sign up for a Subscription Plan, you sign up on a rolling monthly basis. Your Subscription Plan will automatically renew at the end of the current one-month subscription period for a further one-month period unless your Subscription Plan is terminated in accordance with these Terms. You are required to give us notice at least 10 days before the end of your current subscription period if you do not want to renew your Subscription Plan, to give us sufficient time to process your request.</p>
      <p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>8.2 Termination</strong></p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>(a) How can you terminate or cancel your subscription?</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>For any reason</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>As a Subscriber, you can terminate or cancel your Subscription Plan for any reason, or no reason, by notifying us at least 10 days before the renewal of your monthly Subscription Plan, so that we have sufficient time to process your request. This can be done from within the “My Products” page of your “My Account” dashboard or by contacting our customer support team for Australia or New Zealand. The effective date of termination or cancellation will be the last day of the current subscription period (or, if you notify us less than 10 days before the end of the month, the following subscription period). If your Subscription Plan is terminated or canceled, you and your Users will continue to have access to your Subscription Plan until the end of your billing period and the end of the Data Extraction Period described in section 8.3(d).</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods unless expressly set out in these Terms, where otherwise required under Applicable Law, or otherwise agreed with you.</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>For our breach</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>As a Subscriber, you can terminate or cancel your Subscription Plan by providing notice if we fail to remedy a material breach of these Terms within 10 days of you giving us notice of the breach in writing.</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>If we make changes</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>Section 6.5(a) sets out your right to terminate or cancel your Subscription Plan in certain circumstances where we notify you that we intend to make changes to these Terms, your Fees, meMate, or your Subscription Plan.</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>If we suspend performance of our obligations</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>If we suspend the performance of our obligations under these Terms, you have a right, during the period of suspension, to terminate or cancel your Subscription Plan immediately upon notice to us.</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>(b) How can we suspend, terminate, or cancel your Subscription?</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>For any reason</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>We can terminate or cancel your Subscription Plan for any reason by providing you with at least 60 days’ written notice.</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>For your breach</p>
      <p class='sqsRHFont'>We can suspend, terminate, or cancel your Subscription Plan by providing written notice if you fail to remedy a material breach of these Terms within 10 days after we give you written notice of the breach, including without limitation where:</p>
   <ul class='listMargin'>
   <li class='sqsRHFont'>Fees are overdue; or</li>
   <li class='sqsRHFont'>There is a change in who owns or controls the Subscriber where we were not notified in advance about the change in ownership or control, and the new owners have failed to satisfy our reasonable identity and credit check requirements or failed to provide information that we reasonably require to make changes to the Subscriber’s account.</li>

   </ul>
  
   <p class='sqsRHFont'>Immediately</p>
   <p class='sqsRHFont'>We can suspend your Subscription Plan immediately (and will notify you as soon as we reasonably can) if we believe it is reasonably necessary either to protect the security of meMate or the Subscriber Data or any critical meMate functionality. We will lift any suspension as soon as we reasonably can after resolution of the issue(s) giving rise to the suspension.</p>
   <p class='sqsRHFont'>We can suspend, terminate, or cancel your Subscription Plan immediately upon written notice to you (and will notify you as soon as we reasonably can) if:</p>
   <ul class='listMargin'>
   <li class='sqsRHFont'>As a Subscriber, you cease to be able to pay all your debts as they fall due, become insolvent, go into liquidation or administration, bankruptcy, or such other similar arrangement with creditors, or cease to carry on business (subject to any stay requirements under Applicable Law);</li>

   <li class='sqsRHFont'>A change to any Third Party arrangement necessary for meMate renders the ongoing operation of meMate substantially unworkable or non-functional, despite us making reasonable efforts to ensure the ongoing operation of meMate; or </li>
   <li class='sqsRHFont'>The actions of a regulator or a change in Applicable Law or regulation makes the ongoing operation of meMate substantially unworkable or non-functional.</li>
   </ul>
<p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>8.3 What happens on Termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan?</strong></p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(a) End of your Subscription Plan</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>Unless otherwise specified in these Terms or mutually agreed with you in writing, termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan is effective on the last date of your current subscription period. After termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan is effective:</p>

 <ul class='listMargin'>
   <li class='sqsRHFont'>	You and your Users must cease use of meMate; and</li>
   <li class='sqsRHFont'>	You and any Users (including Employees) will only be able to access </li>
   </ul>
   <p class='sqsRHFont'>Subscriber Data for the Data Extraction Period described in section 8.3(d) and may not have access to Subscriber Data after the Data Extraction Period ends.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(b) Payment of Fees still owing</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>After termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan, you must pay any Fees that are due and payable to us (including any variable Pay-Per-Use Fees or Fees for use of Premium Features) up to the date of termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(c) Continuation of limitations on liability</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>Any limitations on liability that apply under these Terms continue after termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(d) Accessing archived Subscriber Data after termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>We strongly recommend that, as a Subscriber, you extract your Subscriber Data for compliance and archive purposes either before termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan or as soon as possible following termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan. Failure to extract and retain your Subscriber Data may result in you being unable to comply with your record retention obligations under Applicable Law (including Tax Law and Employment Law). You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ul class='listMargin'>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>You will have 30 days from the effective date of termination or cancellation of your Subscription Plan to extract your Subscriber Data from meMate (Data Extraction Period) for no additional charge.</li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>The Data Extraction Period also applies to Employees who may need to access their payslips using meMate YourPay.</li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>After the Data Extraction Period, you and your Users (including your Employees and, if applicable, Professional Partner) will not have any further guaranteed access to meMate or your Subscriber Data.</li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>If you need to access your archived Subscriber Data records after the end of your Data Extraction Period, contact us in Australia or New Zealand. Access to archived Subscriber Data may be subject to additional fees and charges and require that you have an active Subscription Plan to view the records. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to recover your historical Subscriber Data, which is why you should keep your own records and copies of Subscriber Data. We may delete Subscriber Data after the Data Extraction Period in accordance with our data retention policies.</li>

  <p class='sqsRHFont'>Our liability to you for any breach by us of these Terms is, if permitted by the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), Consumer Guarantee Act 1993 (NZ CGA), and/or Fair Trading Act 1986 (NZ FTA) (as applicable), limited to:</p>
  <ul class='listMargin'>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>The resupply of meMate or the service (as applicable); or</li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>The cost of resupplying meMate or the service (as applicable),</li>

   <p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>9.2 Where the Australian Consumer Law applies</strong></p>
   <p class='sqsRHFont'>(a) Our goods and services come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. For major failures with the service, you are entitled:</p>

<li class='sqsRHFont'>To cancel your service contract with us; and</li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>To a refund for the unused portion, or to compensation for its reduced value.</li>

  </ul>
   
  <p class='sqsRHFont'>You are also entitled to choose a refund or replacement for major failures with goods. If a failure with the goods or a service does not amount to a major failure, you are entitled to have the failure rectified in a reasonable time. If this is not done, you are entitled to a refund for the goods and to cancel the contract for the service and obtain a refund of any unused portion. You are also entitled to be compensated for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage from a failure in the goods or service.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(b) These Terms do not exclude, restrict, or modify the application of any part of the ACL, or the exercise of any right or remedy conferred by the ACL.</p>
  <p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>9.3 Where the New Zealand Consumer Guarantee Act and Fair Trading Act would otherwise apply</strong></p>
  <p class='sqsRHFont'>(a) For the purposes of section 5D of the NZ FTA and section 43 of the NZ CGA:</p>
<ul class='listMargin'>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>The goods and services provided to you under or in connection with these Terms are being provided and acquired in trade;</li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>If the NZ FTA and/or NZ CGA applies to any goods or services supplied to you under or in connection with these Terms, the parties agree to contract out of the NZ CGA and sections 9, 12A, and 13 of the NZ FTA; and </li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>All representations, conditions, warranties, and terms that would otherwise be expressed or implied in these Terms by general law, statute, or custom are expressly excluded (to the extent that such representations, conditions, warranties, and terms can be excluded at law).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class='sqsRHFont'>(b) Except as specified in section 9.3(a), these Terms do not exclude, restrict, or modify the application of any part of the NZ CGA or NZ FTA, or the exercise of any right or remedy conferred by the NZ CGA or NZ FTA.</p>
<p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>9.4 When we will not be liable to you</strong></p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law and subject to sections 9.2 and 9.3, we are not responsible or liable to you for</p>

<li class='sqsRHFont'>Any Loss or Claim relating to provision or use of the Subscriber Data, Imported Data, Payroll Data, Exported Data, or system data made available through meMate; </li>

<li class='sqsRHFont'>If you are a user of meMate YourPay, any Loss or Claim incurred by you in connection with the submission of inaccurate or incomplete timesheet information by your Employees;</li>
</ul>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>except to the extent caused or contributed to by a breach of Applicable Law or breach of these Terms by us or any Third Party acting on our instructions.</p>
<p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>9.5 We indemnify you for IP Claims</strong></p>

<p class='sqsRHFont'>Subject to you complying with this section 9.5, we indemnify you from and against any Loss or Claim incurred by you arising directly from or in direct connection with a claim by a third party that meMate or its use infringes the Intellectual Property Rights of that third party (“IP Claim”). If an IP Claim is made against you, you must promptly notify us of the IP Claim and give us the right to defend and settle the IP Claim. We will not settle an IP Claim without your prior consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). You must provide reasonable assistance with our defense of the IP claim. The indemnity in this section 9.5 will not apply to the extent that the IP Claim arises or results from your (or your Users’) access or use of meMate in a manner prohibited by us in writing or in breach of these Terms.</p>
<p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>9.6 You indemnify us for third-party claims relating to your use of meMate</strong></p>

<p class='sqsRHFont'>You indemnify us against any Loss or Claim we incur directly from or in direct connection with a third-party claim or action against us relating to your (and your Users’) use of meMate.</p>
<p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>9.7 Limitation of Liability</strong></p>

<p class='sqsRHFont'>(a) Liability cap</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>In no event will either party’s aggregate cumulative liability (whether in contract, tort, negligence, statute, or otherwise) exceed an amount equal to the Fees paid by you to us during the 12-month period preceding the event or occurrence giving rise to such liability.</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>This limitation does not apply to liability:</p>
<ul class='listMargin'>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>That cannot be excluded or limited under Applicable Law;</li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>Arising out of or in connection with sections 9.2—9.3 and 9.5—9.6; or</li>
<li class='sqsRHFont'>Arising out of or in connection with a party’s gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.</li>
</ul>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>(b) Consequential loss excluded</p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>In no event will either party be liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, losses, or expenses (including but not limited to business interruption, loss of data, lost business, loss of revenue, or lost profits) even if it has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>9.8 Proportionate liability</strong></p>

<p class='sqsRHFont'>To the extent permissible under Applicable Law, each party’s liability under these Terms (including under an indemnity) is reduced proportionately to the extent that such liability is caused or contributed to by the breach of these Terms or the wrongful, unlawful, or negligent act or omission of the other party or its directors, officers, employees, agents, or subcontractors.</p>
<p><strong class='sqsSBHFont'>9.9 Duty to mitigate</strong></p>
<p class='sqsRHFont'>Each party must use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate its Losses.</p>

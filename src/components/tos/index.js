Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and to everyone’s satisfaction by contacting our support team by scrolling to the bottom of any support article on meMate Central.

<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Important Housekeeping</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
Here we set out some additional terms. Take a read as they cover important issues.

</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>No Professional Advice</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
Just to be clear, meMate isn’t a professional services firm of any sort, and isn’t in the business of giving any kind of professional advice. We may provide you with information we think might be useful in running a small business, but this should not be seen as a substitute for professional advice and we aren’t liable for your use of the information in that way.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Events Outside Our Control</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
We do our best to control the controllable. We aren’t liable to you for any failure or delay in performance of any of our obligations under these terms arising out of any event or circumstance beyond our reasonable control.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Notices</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
Any notice you send to meMate must be sent to me@meMate.com.au Any notices we send to you will be sent to the email address you’ve provided us through your subscription.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Exclusion </strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
If you reside in those countries, your country’s non-excludable guarantees still apply – these terms do not exclude, restrict or modify them. Except for non-excludable guarantees and other rights you have that we cannot exclude, we’re bound only by the express promises made in these terms. Our liability for breach of a non-excludable guarantee is limited, at our option, to either replacing or paying the cost of replacing the relevant service (unless the non-excludable guarantee says otherwise).
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Export Limitations</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
You must not use our services in violation of any export or trade embargo laws that apply to you.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Excluded Terms</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) do not apply to these terms.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Blocking Your Access, Disabling Your Subscription, or Refusing to Process a Payment</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
 As our sites are global, different laws may apply in different countries that restrict our relationship with you. We may block your access, terminate your subscription, or refuse to process a payment if we reasonably believe there’s a risk - like a potential breach of a law or regulation - associated with you, your company, your subscription, or a payment. Examples of where we might do this include transactions where the payment is from a sanctioned person or country; or where we reasonably believe there is a legal or regulatory risk or a risk of loss being suffered by us or our customers or partners. You promise that you’re not located in a sanctioned country and are not on a sanctioned persons list. We may also block users from a country if we can’t receive payments from that country. You should check what payment methods are available in your country for making payments. We may take any of these actions without notice.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Relationship Between the Parties</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
Nothing in these terms is to be construed as constituting a partnership, joint venture, employment or agency relationship between you and us, or between you and any other subscriber or invited user.
 </p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Transfer of These Terms</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
meMate may transfer these terms - or any of our rights or obligations in these terms - to another entity as it deems appropriate. Where the transfer relates to meMate or a big part of meMate being sold to a third party or merged with a third party, we will give you written notice of that. A subscriber can transfer a subscription to a new subscriber in accordance with section 9.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Changes to These Terms</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
We sometimes will decide to change these terms of use. But don’t worry, changes won’t apply retrospectively and, if we make changes, we’ll make every effort to let you know. You can keep track of changes to our terms by referring to the version and the date last updated at the top of the terms. We will reasonably endeavour to provide you with 60 days’ notice of material changes before they become effective, unless we need to make immediate changes for reasons we don’t have control over. When we notify you, we’ll do it by email or by posting a visible notice through our services. If meMate decides in its reasonable discretion that a change isn’t material, we may not notify you. If you find a modified term unacceptable, you may terminate your subscription by giving the standard advance notice to meMate.

</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Enforcement of Terms</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
If there’s any part of these terms that either one of us is unable to enforce, we’ll ignore that part but everything else will remain enforceable.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>Interpretation</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
Words like ‘include’ and ‘including’ are not words of limitation and where anything is within our discretion we mean our sole discretion.
</p>

</li>
<li>
<strong class='sqsSBHFont'>meMate Contracting Entities; Law and Venue</strong>
<p class='paraTextTos'>
Our contracting entities are listed below along with what law and venue apply in any dispute between you and us. meMate entities are the companies controlled by or under common control with meMate Enterprise Limited
